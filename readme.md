## My stupid plan:

- Task model with te basic methods, sortings and other funny stuff (right here now)
- Dumb CLI to create/update/delete tasks. Like task warrior, but realy and realy simple.
- Some shit that I didn't planned...
- MOST AWESOME TASK MANAGER WEB SITE EVER WITHOUT STUPID SHIT. IT WILL MAKE ME SUPER UNPROCRASTINATED AND PRODUCTIVE!!!1111oneone11
